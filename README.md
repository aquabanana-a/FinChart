Assigned task

Using the SciChart library, create an application in Kotlin.

1. The application should consist of a candlestick stock chart (OHLCV) with a volume histogram placed in an additional (bottom) pane.
2. Place the time axis on the volume histogram.
3. Add a crosshair cursor. The cursor should be activated by holding a finger on the chart. Movement along the time axis should snap strictly to the center of the candlesticks, similar to the cursor behavior in TradingView.

Additionally:

1. Obtain a SciChart demo license independently.
2. For building the chart, use EURUSD 1h data for the period from 16.06.25 to 18.06.16 inclusive (see file).
3. Please ensure the functionality, control methodology, and design are similar to cTrader or TradingView.
